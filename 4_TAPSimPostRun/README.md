# TAPSim Post-Processing

This directory contains scripts and resources for post-processing the output data generated by TAPSim field evaporation simulations. The main purpose is to convert, organize, and analyze the simulation results so they can be used for further molecular dynamics simulations, visualization, and quantitative analysis.

## Purpose

After running TAPSim simulations, the output files (such as grid data and surface data) are not immediately ready for downstream analysis or MD coupling. The scripts in this directory automate the extraction, conversion, and formatting of these files, ensuring that the data is consistent and usable for subsequent steps in the workflow.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Grid Data Processing:**  
   The `gridDataProcessing.py` script reads TAPSim grid data files, extracts relevant atomic and field information, performs necessary unit conversions (e.g., meters to Ã…ngstroms, electric field units), and writes the results in LAMMPS-compatible format for further simulation or analysis.

2. **Surface Data Processing:**  
   The `surfaceDataProcessing.py` script processes TAPSim surface data files, extracts emitter atom positions and field values, converts units, and generates both CSV and LAMMPS-format files. This enables direct coupling with molecular dynamics simulations and facilitates visualization.

3. **Output Organization:**  
   Converted files are saved in dedicated output directories (`converted_grid_data`, `converted_surface_data`) for easy access and management. Each processed file is named according to its time snapshot or simulation step.

## How to Use

- **Step 1:** Place the TAPSim output files (from the `simulations/` directory in `3_TAPsimRun`) in the expected location or update the script paths as needed.
- **Step 2:** Edit the emitter type variable in each script (`emittertype = '100_W'` or `'110_W'`) to match your simulation.
- **Step 3:** Run the Python scripts (`gridDataProcessing.py` and `surfaceDataProcessing.py`) to process all relevant files.
- **Step 4:** Use the generated LAMMPS-format files for further MD simulations or analysis.

## Notes

- The scripts are designed to handle large batches of TAPSim output files automatically.
- Unit conversions are performed to ensure compatibility with LAMMPS and standard analysis tools.
- The processed data includes atomic positions, electric field vectors, and other relevant quantities for each emitter atom.
